I am a Ph.D student in the Complex Resilient Intelligent Systems (CRIS) group of Professor Venkat Venkatasubramanian at Columbia University, New York.

My core research areas of interest include machine learning and artificial intelligence for retrosynthetic planning and novel materials/drug discovery; studying emergent phenomena through nature inspired algorithms like particle swarm optimization and evolutionary programming; and studying complex emergent systems.

I graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2017. Post graduation, I worked in the industry for 2 years in data science roles and worked on problems ranging from fault detection and diagnosis, multidimensional optimization problems, and sports analytics problems.

Outside of academics, I am excited about running, swimming, and reading books!

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was drizzling in the city. We were walking side by side on the sidewalk, enjoying the weather, and discussing our plans for the night. The feeling of walking beside her and occasionally putting my arm around her shoulder was exactly what I was craving for since the last couple of weeks. I was just moments away from a state of bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly, out of nowhere, an auto-rickshaw drove past us and splashed an insane amount of water logged on the road on to us. I was the one who received most of it but her dress and purse got spoilt too. It wasn't that bad but it was enough to spoil her mood for 4 complete minutes. She got mad - scolded me for everything that I had done in the past few hours which includes making her walk for 1.5 km to the caf√© and not letting her bring the umbrella along earlier in the day. I was just finding it funny but she was furious mostly because of her <em>Caprese</em> bag that got stained too. But I didn't care. I was totally enjoying the moment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After we cleaned ourselves up, a thought struck the both of us - why don't we write about such experiences so that we could read them up later and relive the memories? The actual trigger to this thought might have been a movie called 'The Notebook' that she made me watch the previous night in which the guy writes 365 letters to his girlfriend. Whatever be the actual trigger event, we realized that writing about our experiences, or about anything for that matter would be a beautiful hobby that both of us could take up. Professionally too, it would help us in becoming more articulate, expressive, and obviously help me in writing better research papers in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyhow, getting splashed by that auto-rickshaw driver was a good thing that happened to the both of us and we really are thankful to him. Had he not done that, we would probably never have thought of writing blogs for a long, long time.</p>
